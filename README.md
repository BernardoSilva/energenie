# Energenie Demo

A fork of the Python game 'Memory Puzzle' used to demonstrate the Energenie board

- [energenie.py](energenie.py) is a basic demonstration of switching power switches on and off with Python
- [memorypuzzle.py](memorypuzzle.py) is a modified version of a game which plays music and turns on a power switch when the player wins
